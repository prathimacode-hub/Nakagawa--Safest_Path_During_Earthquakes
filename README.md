# Nakagawa--Safest_Path_During_Earthquakes

Natural Disasters are problems in Japan, with risk of earthquakes, floods and tsunamis. Japan has well-developed disaster response systems, but densely populated cities and narrow roads make managing the response difficult. By giving individuals information about the safest ways from their homes and places of work, it will increase their awareness of the surrounding area and improve their preparedness.
