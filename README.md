# Nakagawa--Safest_Path_During_Earthquakes

## Problem Statement

Natural Disasters are problems in Japan, with risk of earthquakes, floods and tsunamis. Japan has well-developed disaster response systems, but densely populated cities and narrow roads make managing the response difficult. By giving individuals information about the safest ways from their homes and places of work, it will increase their awareness of the surrounding area and improve their preparedness.

Challenge hosted by **Omdena - Japan Chapter**

**Omdena Japan Chapter Challenge Original Repo** : https://github.com/OmdenaAI/omdena-japan-finding-paths-to-safety-following-natural-disasters

**Japan Safest Path Dashboard Streamlit App** : https://share.streamlit.io/prathimacode-hub/safest-path-during-earthquakes/main/app.py

## Project Goals

• collect satellite images and identify road characteristics

• build a model for scoring the roads in terms of their suitability for use in emergency

• build a pathfinding model from A to B, combining it with road characteristics

• suggest safest path from A to B

• publish interactive dashboards to display road characteristics and safest paths

• arrange demonstration and publicise to local audiences

## Location Choosen

We had choosen "Nakagawa-Ku as our region of interest, which comes under Aichi prefecture of Nagoya City. It comes under Chubu region and is the 4th densely populated city in Japan with high risk prone to disasters.

## Developments Made

• We had designed a model collecting data about the local roads from satellite images, classify them and indicate the safest route to be taken from point A to point B and an interactive dashboard to display the safest route in a map.

• By making individuals aware, it will improve their preparedness and it can be used within families to prepare disaster response plans, depending on their circumstances. To be used by individuals, families and groups, and foreign residents who may not understand local information. Further development will be covering more geographical areas and publicising on a local level.
